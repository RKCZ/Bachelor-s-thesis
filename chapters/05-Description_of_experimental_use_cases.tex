\chapter{Description of experimental use cases} \label{chapter:05}

This chapter describes the initial experiments with the Nengo simulator and the SNN-Toolbox, which were selected as the most appropriate tools for subsequent use in this work. The decision was based on the pieces of information stated about the individual tools in the previous chapters. Both tools aim to use analogue neural networks to train the model and then convert it to the spiking alternative for inference. This approach is more utilisable for practical needs at the moment because other approaches to use SNNs suffer from issues described in chapter \ref{chapter:02} above. Thus, it is complicated to use them for any practical application such as image recognition. However, they are still necessary for research in the area of spiking networks and scientific experiments. \par
