\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap:07}

This work attempts to clarify the main distinctions between analogue neural networks and spiking neural networks, depict the current state of research in the area of the spiking networks and demonstrate the findings on a selected machine learning problem with the help of selected instruments. It was described how spiking networks can be beneficial in research for their biological similarities with biological neural systems, and their fitness for utilization in embedded applications. The work later focuses on the collation of the most advanced simulators of spiking networks. Nengo ecosystem and SNN-Toolbox were selected for the subsequent experiments. Firstly, it was outlined how these tools work on a use case where a base analogue network was converted with both tools and evaluated on the MNIST image classification dataset. Results of both converted networks were comparable with results of the base model. The main contribution of this work is a conversion of an earlier convolutional network for event-related potentials classification. The achieved results do not surpass the results of the original network. \par
